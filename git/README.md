## Learning Objectives
- What is source code management
- What is **Git**
- What is **GitHub**
- What is the **difference between** Git and GitHub
- How to create a **repository**
- What is a **README**
- How to write **good** READMEs
- How to **commit**
- How to write **helpful commit** messages
- How to **push code**
- How to **pull updates**
- How to **create** a **branch**
- How to **merge** branches
- How to work as **collaborators** on a project
- Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo

## Requirements
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. git), describing what this project is about
- Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
- Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else



## More info
### Install `git`
If `git` is not already installed on your terminal:

- `$ sudo apt-get update`
- `$ sudo apt-get upgrade`
- `$ sudo apt-get install git`

### Basic Usage
At the end of this project you should be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

- `$ git clone <repo>`
- `$ touch test`
- `$ git add test`
- `$ git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- `$ git push origin main`
